# NukkitVersionSupport - Nukkit Plugin

**This is no longer supported.** It has become difficult to maintain a plugin dedicated for protocol support. **However, I am now working on a fork of Nukkit which currently supports 1.16.100+.** In the future, I hope to also support 1.16.40 and any future versions of Minecraft. Check out the fork [here!](https://github.com/Mooncraft-Games/MadNukkit)

**NukkitVersionSupport** is a plugin for the [Nukkit Minecraft Server Software](https://github.com/CloudburstMC/Nukkit) that can allow earlier versions of Minecraft to join the latest supported version at this moment. (1.16.200)

## Version Support

Currently, this plugin supports upgrading clients connected on 1.16.100

<!-- TODO: Add a tutorial on how to add version support for future versions -->
